# Course_VMs_and_Target_Servers
Issue tracker for reporting improvements to course virtual machines and target servers

Please start all issue names with `D#-###: ` where the `#` following the `D` is the day/book number and the `###` is the page number.  So for example, if you have a suggestion or idea to improve content on page 10 of day 4, please start the report with:

`D4-10: I love topic, you provide a reference to after the fourth bullet in the slide`

`D1-108: Change better to best in the second paragraph in the notes`

Also, if at all possible, please include the book version you have in the body of the issue, this is found on the bottom of the copyright page in form of `D02_01` or `E01_03`.  That will help as well as sometimes we have have two different versions of the course running at the same time during transitions.
